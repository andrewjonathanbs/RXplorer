# RXplorer
RXplorer is a personal project where I created educational games to help pharmacy students learn more effectively, efficiently, while lessening their academic pressure by gamification and low stake assignment. 
Now, RXplorer development is being halted for a while due to various reasons.
        
• Developed the game prototype using RenPy.     
• Designed the game and website UI using Figma. 
• Created character illustrations and assets with Procreate.    
• Increase production of new products (game cases) from 2 weeks / case to 3 days / case by creating guidelines and templates which enable faster production of games with consistent quality.   
• Coordinated my teammates in business plan competitions to gather fundings and generate game cases.
